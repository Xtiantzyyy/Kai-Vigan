                    In
                    pre-colonial
                    times, Chinese used Vigan as a coastal trading post. Chinese traders
                    sailed from
                    West Philippine Sea to Isla de Vigan (Island of Vigan) by the Mestizo River. In the
                    late-1500s, Spain
                    colonized the Philippines and the historic town of Vigan was established. It
                    resulted to
                    unique
                    architectural design which developed the awesome townscape and culture of the place.
                    Vigan is also
                    known as the well-preserved city and a known UNESCO World Heritage site.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was believed that when Juan de Salcedo asked a native what the name of the place
                    is,
                    (as Salcedo
                    spoke in Spanish), the native could not understand a word he was saying. Salcedo
                    however
                    was pointing
                    on the ground and the native thought that he was actually asking for the name of the
                    vegetation planted
                    on the ground. He thereupon said “bigaa apo, bigaa apo”, referring to a tuber plant
                    from
                    the “gabi” or taro
                    family. From then on the Spaniards named the place Bigan.

                                    is a hard process to create an abel cloth since the weavers must synchronize
                                    their hands and feet while weaving. It can be used as a blanket, sweaters,
                                    tablemat, and pillow-case.

                                    The Vigan streets are filled with lights or in Ilocano "raniag." As far as a City

                                    “twilight,” as in Raniag the Vigan Twilight Festival 2017. This was because twilight
                                    may be considered the witching hour, November being the Halloween season. So the
                                    recent Raniag festival in the Heritage City had its share of ghostly figures and
                                    horror masks. There are the lights that combat the fear of the younger about ghost
                                    stories and urban legend. The float parade is in fact the highlight of the festival
                                    featuring the creativity of the Bigueños.

                                    street dancing honors the Abel Iloko, a traditional craft of Vigan that has
                                    sustained its economy from
                                    the Pre-Spanish Period to the Present. The Binatbatan festival highlights the annual
