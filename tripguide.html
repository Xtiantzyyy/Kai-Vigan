        <h2>About <strong>Vigan</strong></h2>
        <p>Vigan was spared from the devastation of war by a beautiful love tale between a Japanese and a Bigueña (term for a Vigan woman).
          <br> A Japanese military commander fell in love with a Bigueña, and since he didn't want his loved one to be left suffering and 
          <br>having a horrible life as a result of war's destruction, he abandoned the Japanese command for the sake of love. 
          <br>Isn't it romantic? That is why the historic homes of Vigan are still intact and a romance has been preserved.</p>

            Calle Crisologo owes its name to the illustrious Ilocano poet, writer, and playwright Governor Marcelino “Mena” Crisologo. Previously, the street was called Calle de Escolta de Vigan, whose residents were mostly families who profited from the galleon trade that included Ilocos as a key port. When Governor Crisologo died in 1927, the street was renamed Calle Crisologo in his honor.

            The Syquia Mansion is a wonderful example of bahay na bato architecture prevalent during the later Spanish Colonial Era. The typical structure consisted of a ground floor made of stone or brick and mortar with the upper floors of wood. No cement, no hollow blocks, no steel bars. No blueprints either. This mansion was built using a craftsman’s expert eye and traditional building materials.
