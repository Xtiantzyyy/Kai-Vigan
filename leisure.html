                    One of the most popular tourist attractions in Vigan is an old Jar factory locally called Pagburnayan. Pottery or Burnay making is already considered a dying tradition; the last pot maker or Pagburnayan may not have his successor in the future. Burnay is earthen jars with small openings, while those with bigger mouths are called wangging. You can try making your jars in this place.

                    The Vigan City Fiesta is held every January 25. The city has a longganisa-themed parade and at one time attempted to set a record for having the longest longganisa ever made. The festival has become a crowd-drawer as Vigan longganisa, a native version of Mexican salami, has a distinct garlicky taste that has become a favorite of the Filipino palate.

                    The picturesque Bantay Bell Tower overlooks the stunning view of the mountains in nearby province of Abra and the vast West Philippine Sea. During World Wars I and II, the belfry was used as a watchtower for invading enemy forces. Clearly, this manifests how Bantay Church and Bell Tower became monumental witnesses to different significant and historical events during those days.
